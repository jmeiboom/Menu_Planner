1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.
2. To make the dough: Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients by hand, mixer, or bread machine to make a soft, smooth dough.
3. Cover the dough and let it rise until it's nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours.
4. To shape the buns: Gently deflate the dough and divide it into eight pieces (about 100g each); to make smaller or larger buns see 'tips,' below. Shape each piece into a ball.
5. Flatten each dough ball with the palm of your hand until it's about 3 inches across.
6. Place the buns on a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until noticeably puffy, about an hour. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375F.
7. Brush the buns with about half of the melted butter. To make seeded buns, brush the egg white/water mixture right over the melted butter; it'll make the seeds adhere. Sprinkle buns with the seeds of your choice.
8. To bake the buns: Bake the buns for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove them from the oven and brush with the remaining melted butter; this will give the buns a satiny, buttery crust. If you've made seeded buns apply the melted butter carefully, to avoid brushing the seeds off the buns.
9. Cool the buns on a rack before slicing in half, horizontally. Use as a base for burgers (beef or plant-based) or any favorite sandwich filling.
10. Storage information: Store leftover buns, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
